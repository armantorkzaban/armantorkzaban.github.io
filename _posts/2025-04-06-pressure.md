Recent Iranian is under enormous amount of pressure. Socially, economically, and psychologically we get bombarded everyday. Some of us experience worse situations than others. The poor, kids, women,elderly and people with disabilities. Among those who silently suffer are a some of exiles and activists who can't easily forget the cause.
The duality of life, in place and in mind can cause you to age faster. For this gourp the pressure comes with the ideals; the farther the ideals and the stronger the inertia of the status quo, the harder they will try.
