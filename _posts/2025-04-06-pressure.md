title: pressure
---

Recent Iranian is under enormous amount of pressure. Socially, economically, and psychologically we get bombarded everyday. Some of us have worse situations than others. The poor, kids, women,elderly and people with disabilities. 
Exiles and activists can also suffer a lot. The duality of life, in place and in mind. Sometimes the extra pressure come with the ideals. The farther the ideal is from today, and the more one works on the ideals, and the stronger the inertia of the status quo is.
