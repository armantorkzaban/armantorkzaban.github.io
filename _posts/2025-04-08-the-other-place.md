Today I'd like to introduce The Other Place the documentary movie.
This moving documentary sheds light on the difficult lives of queer Iranians in Iran, when they leave Iran, and eventually for the lucky ones, when settles in a safe country.
I will extend this post to include information about the research project behind it but for now, check: iranqueerrefugee.net & be informed that on May 6th we will in cooperation with local organisations and the cinema screen this movie.
'we' means Transnationak Community Federation e. V., the nonprofit organisation I work for which was a member of the board of advisor of the aforementioned research.
